# HW-1

The goal of this project was to make the code more accessible. Basically meaning it is easier to read and follow. What I did is explained below.

## Edits to HTML <div>

A lot of the div tags were lacking semantics, so I replaced them with the correct ones. Semantics used involved header, nav, main, section, and footer. Now, the code will be easier to follow and read. The main tag was used to distinguish the main content of the webpage, while the section tag distinguished the information to the right of the main content.

### Edits to HTML elements

First, the title of the webpage was changed to better represent the content of the webpage. It is also less than 155 characters, which I heard from Chris. Also, it will now help with SEO and search results.

Second, certain places of the code had an id and a class to define it. When I looked in the CSS file, there were no id tags used. Therefore, I removed the id attribute from the HTML file.

Third, I removed the classes for the tags that had a distinct semantic tag for them. I thought it was unnecessary for them to have a class.

Lastly, I added descriptive alt values to the images, in case the images did not load. 

#### Edits to CSS

First, I reorganized the code so that it read similarly to what the webpage looked like. From top to bottom, it read body, header, nav, main, section, and then footer. This made things easier to find.

Second, I changed some of the classes into tags because semantics allowed us to simply things. For instance, the footer class wasn't needed no more since the tag became footer.

##### What I Learned

I learned that messy code can be difficult to work with. I would be looking at code and not know what it's purpose was. Along with that, it took me longer to find certain things. For instance, the code in the CSS file was scattered a bit. The code that affected the footer wasn't at the bottom. With files with more code than this, it can be much harder to find what one is looking for. Other than that, I learned that each header size should be used only once.
